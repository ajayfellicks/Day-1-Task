What is a JavaScript object?

A JavaScript object is a collection of unordered properties. 
Properties can usually be changed, added, and deleted, but some are read only.

Objects in JavaScript are very much similar to the objects in real-life. 
We can see a lot of Objects around us in this real world, each with its own set of properties. 
For instance let us take a table in the real world, it has its own properties like height, width, and length etc. 
Similarly all the Objects in the JavaScript are associated with its own set of properties.
